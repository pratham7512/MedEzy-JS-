                    <p>
                    1.Practice Good Hygiene**: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially before touching your face, eyes, or applying contact lenses. Avoid rubbing or touching your eyes with unwashed hands as this can transfer germs.

                    <p>
                    2.Avoid Touching Eyes**: Try to refrain from rubbing or touching your eyes, especially when you've been in public spaces or around individuals with cold-like symptoms. This helps prevent the transfer of viruses or bacteria to your eyes.

                    <p>
                    3.Clean and Disinfect**: Regularly clean surfaces that come into frequent contact with your face, such as phones, eyeglasses, and makeup tools. Disinfecting these surfaces can reduce the chances of transmitting viruses or bacteria to your eyes.

                    <p>
                    4.Practice Eye Care with Contact Lenses**: If you wear contact lenses, follow proper hygiene practices. Wash your hands thoroughly before handling lenses, clean and disinfect them as recommended, and avoid wearing lenses when your eyes are irritated or infected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    5.Avoid Sharing Personal Items**: Refrain from sharing personal items that come into contact with the eyes, such as towels, pillows, eye makeup, or eye drops. Sharing these items can spread infections or allergens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Remember, while these tips can help reduce the risk of contracting eye flu, it's essential to seek advice from a healthcare professional if you suspect you have an eye infection or experience symptoms such as redness, itchiness, discharge, or blurred vision.
